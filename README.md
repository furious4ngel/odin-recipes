# Recipes
This is my first project submission for The Odin Project
curriculum. It is a collection of basic recipes.

## What's New?
With the knowledge I gained so far, I gave this site a
makeover, starting with using `box-sizing: border-box;`
instead of `content-box` in the CSS (haha). I also took
advantage of sectioning elements, sticky headers, using
a responsive layout, animations, and JS to create
a prettier site.
